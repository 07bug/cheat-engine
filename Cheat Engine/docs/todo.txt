creating a new tab with a groupscan setup looks bad

structure dissect: 
  use pdb data if available
  delete all structures sometimes AV's
  adding names in front messes up the header names


for .net games let stucture dissect see those structures aS WELL
AND LUA

triggering hotkeys (no matter what they do) while in settings breaks CE completely
add AVX support

mono dissect: order methods by alphabet

mono invoke: add option for async execution (so it doesn't crash in the pipe)

memview paste: paste for specific displaytype
memview->rightclick while debugging: Change eip to position, run till position in the context menu as well


add enumStructureWindows list, and let lua change the selected struct
trainergen: get rid of tcheat and just use labels

graphical memory view: 
  change format makes it black sometimes(loses position ?)
  sometimes the x position is not 0, but can't be changed back

memview debugging: add a toolbar for single step/step over so you can debug by clicking icons

dbvm_speedhack

lua getWindowlist does not return the same list as the windowlist


find higher resolution icons

linux: make a 32-bit linux build with .so injection support
memscan: Don't combine the scanresults into a single file. Leave them split up (skip: for 6.7 or 7.0)

ceshare: continue with it
pseudocode: continue with it
mac version: work on it
